# studybud - Django web app

### This project was built by me just for practice. 

A web application that allows users to sign up and create study rooms based on various topics of interest. 

## Features:

• An authentication system that allows only valid users log into the app, redirects invalid users to a sign up page.

• Users can create study rooms that can accommodate other users where they can share resources and network

• Room owners can edit and and update the title of a room

• Each room has a user comment section.

• Every user has a user profile which can be updated by only that user. 

• An activity component that displays recent activities on the app.

• A room component that shows all the active rooms 

# Files and directories 

Model.py contains the database design code 
Templates: A directory that contains all html being rendered into the app

Views.py: This is the code that renders the page and contains function based views that are called based on the url.

URLs.py: Contains all the available routes that can be accessed by users.


# More to do 

I intend to add an invitation feature where users can Invite other users to join a room.

I'm open to learning more about django, reach out to me via email if you have resources that would be of help to me.
